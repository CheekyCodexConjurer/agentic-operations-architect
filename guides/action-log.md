# Action Log Guide

Action Log is the operational memory of what the agent did, why, and how it was
validated. It must be updated for every meaningful change.

## Files
- `.agent-docs/memory/ACTION_LOG.md` for human audit.
- `.agent-docs/memory/ACTION_LOG.jsonl` for machine mining.
- `.agent-docs/memory/HANDOFF.md` for continuity snapshots.

## Rules
- Keep entries short and factual.
- Always include verification evidence.
- Record commands that were executed.
