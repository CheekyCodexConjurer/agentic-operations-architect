# Codex Skills Guide

Codex-native skills live under `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and use
YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). This repo keeps a dual layer:

- `.agent-docs/skills/` for documentation.
- `.codex/skills/` for native skill activation.

## Usage
- Copy `templates/.codex/skills/` into the target repo as `.codex/skills/`.
- Keep skill instructions concise and focused.
