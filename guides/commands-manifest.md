# Commands and Manifest Guide

This guide defines how to capture runnable commands and machine-readable
repository facts.

## Files
- `.agent-docs/memory/COMMANDS.md`
- `.agent-docs/memory/COMMANDS.json`
- `.agent-docs/memory/MANIFEST.yaml`

## Rules
- Record best-known commands with confidence.
- Prefer verified commands when possible.
- Update the manifest when entrypoints or tooling change.
- Use these commands to populate `QUALITY_GATES.md`.
