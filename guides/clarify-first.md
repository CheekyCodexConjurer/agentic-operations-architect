# Clarify First Guide

This guide ensures the agent only asks questions when needed.

## Workflow
1. Ask clarifying questions only when blocked or high-risk.
2. Suggest optimizations briefly if they are low-risk.
3. Proceed with implementation by default.
4. Ask for approval only if ambiguity blocks correctness.
5. Keep questions short and focused.

## Autonomy Installer
- During `autonomy_kickoff`, only ask response style and refactor gate.
