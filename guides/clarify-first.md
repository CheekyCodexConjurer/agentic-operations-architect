# Clarify First Guide

This guide ensures the agent does not implement changes before clarifying
requirements and getting approval.

## Workflow
1. Identify ambiguities and ask clarifying questions.
2. Suggest optimizations or improvements.
3. Ask if the user wants to proceed with implementation.
4. Implement only after explicit approval, unless Full Auth is granted.
5. Keep questions short and focused.
