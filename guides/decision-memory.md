# Decision Memory Guide

Architectural decisions must be explicit and auditable. Use ADRs to capture
context, decision, and consequences for major changes.

## When to Write an ADR
- Major architectural shifts or rewrites.
- Library or framework replacements.
- Breaking changes to interfaces or data flows.

## ADR Structure
- Context: the problem and constraints.
- Decision: the chosen solution.
- Alternatives: options considered.
- Consequences: trade-offs and follow-up work.
