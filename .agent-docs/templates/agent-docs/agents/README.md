# Agents

This folder stores agent instruction templates and proposals.
Keep agents small, scoped, and easy to update.

## Usage
- Copy `AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` into the target scope as `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep root `AGENTS.md` minimal and route to scoped agents.
- Use the Agent Registry to track status, owners, and drift.
- Mark permanent agents as `fixed: true` in the registry.
