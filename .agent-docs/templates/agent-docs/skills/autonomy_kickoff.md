# Autonomy Kickoff

Use this skill when the user requests repository autonomy.
1. Ask only for response style.
2. Run non-destructive bootstrap and merge protocol.
3. Run `analyze_repo_capabilities` and `detect_commands`.
4. Populate `QUALITY_GATES.md` with best-known commands.
5. Run `repo_indexer`, `skills_auditor`, and `skills_sync`.
6. Run architecture mapping (index-first, baseline in `overview.md`).
7. Initialize Action Log, Handoff, Backlog, and line budgets.
8. Run `refactor_gate` after mapping.
9. Mark `AUTONOMY_MODE.md` as done.
10. Continue end-to-end unless blocked.
