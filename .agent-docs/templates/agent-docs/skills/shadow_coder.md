# The Shadow Coder

Use this skill to build parallel architectures safely.
1. Create a non-destructive path (e.g. `_next_gen/`).
2. Mirror interfaces while keeping current behavior stable.
3. Validate the new path with tests or benchmarks.
4. Propose migration steps once the shadow path proves stable.
