# Update Architecture Map

Use this guide when code changes impact architecture.
1. Locate the affected entrypoints and components.
2. Update interaction and flow maps with new edges.
3. Update `.agent-docs/architecture/overview.md` as baseline truth.
4. Refresh component profiles if interfaces or boundaries changed.
5. Refresh `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.agent-docs/architecture.md` indexes.
6. Use the architecture mapping checklist for completeness.
7. Record notable changes in the ADR log.
