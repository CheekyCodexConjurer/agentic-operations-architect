# The Cartographer

Use this skill to maintain living architecture maps.
1. Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` as a lightweight index only.
2. Maintain the baseline map in `.agent-docs/architecture/overview.md`.
3. Update `.agent-docs/architecture/interaction-map.md`.
4. Update `.agent-docs/architecture/flow-map.md`.
5. Refresh `.agent-docs/architecture.md` after changes.
6. Apply line budgets and split large maps when needed.
