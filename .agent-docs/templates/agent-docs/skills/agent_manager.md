# Agent Manager

Use this guide to auto-manage agent lifecycle and coverage.
1. Scan for `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.override.md`.
2. Update `AGENTS_REGISTRY.md` and `AGENTS_REGISTRY.json`.
3. Propose missing agents in `AGENT_PROPOSALS.md` with objective and scope.
4. Explain proposals and request approval before scaffolding.
5. Mark drifted agents as `needs_update` if scope files are newer.
6. Treat `fixed` agents as read-only; propose updates instead.
7. When proposals are approved, scaffold new `AGENTS.md` files.
8. Use the agent management checklist for completeness.
