# Maintain Auto Context

Use this guide to keep long-run context fresh and useful.
1. Append short checkpoints after major milestones.
2. Keep entries minimal and link to files or decisions.
3. Rotate per task: archive as `AUTO_CONTEXT_<timestamp>_<slug>.md`.
4. Start a new auto-context file for the next task.
