# Context Compactor

Use this skill to keep long-run context small and high-signal.
1. Summarize the current state into `HANDOFF.md`.
2. Archive completed task notes from `AUTO_CONTEXT.md`.
3. Update `BACKLOG.md` with open items.
4. Respect `LINE_BUDGETS.yaml` limits.
5. Record a compact Action Log entry.
