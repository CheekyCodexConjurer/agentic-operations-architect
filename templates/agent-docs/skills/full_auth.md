# Full Auth

Use this skill only when the user explicitly authorizes end-to-end execution.

## Protocol
- Produce a phased plan first, then execute all phases in one run.
- Stop only when Definition of Done is met.
- Ask a single blocking question only if truly blocked.

## Definition of Done (generic)
- Safety validation passed (`.agentignore` respected).
- Tests/checks/build executed as applicable and recorded.
- Files changed are listed and summarized.
