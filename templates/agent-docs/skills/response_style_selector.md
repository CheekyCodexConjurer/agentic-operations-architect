# Response Style Selector

Use this skill on first interaction to set the response style.
1. Ask the user to choose: technical or humanized.
2. Record the choice in `USER_PREFERENCES.md`.
3. Keep responses short and aligned to the chosen style.
4. Allow the user to change the style later.

## Humanized Mode
- Short, plain language with minimal bullets.
- Minimal code details unless requested.
