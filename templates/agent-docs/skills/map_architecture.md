# Map Architecture

Use this guide to build and maintain the architecture map.
1. Inventory entrypoints (CLI, web, jobs, tests, scripts).
2. Build a dependency list per entrypoint and component.
3. Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` as a lightweight index.
4. Update `architecture/overview.md` with baseline truth.
5. Record interactions in `architecture/interaction-map.md`.
6. Document critical flows in `architecture/flow-map.md`.
7. Capture gaps and confidence levels in the index.
8. Split large maps per domain to respect line budgets.
9. Update auto-context checkpoints as you progress.
