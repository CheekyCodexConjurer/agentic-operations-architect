# Map Architecture

Use this guide to build and maintain the architecture map.
1. Inventory entrypoints (CLI, web, jobs, tests, scripts).
2. Build a dependency list per entrypoint and component.
3. Record interactions in `architecture/interaction-map.md`.
4. Document critical flows in `architecture/flow-map.md`.
5. Capture gaps and confidence levels in the index.
6. Update auto-context checkpoints as you progress.
