# Autonomy Kickoff

Use this skill when the user requests repository autonomy.
1. Ask only for response style.
2. Run non-destructive bootstrap and merge protocol.
3. Run `analyze_repo_capabilities`.
4. Run `repo_indexer`, `skills_auditor`, and `skills_sync`.
5. Run architecture mapping (index-first, baseline in `overview.md`).
6. Initialize Action Log, Handoff, Backlog, and line budgets.
7. Run `refactor_gate` after mapping.
8. Continue end-to-end unless blocked.
