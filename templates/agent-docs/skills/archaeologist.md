# The Archaeologist

Use this skill to detect legacy and avoid inconsistent refactors.
1. Identify older patterns and newer conventions in the repo.
2. Decide whether to modernize globally or preserve local consistency.
3. Document the decision and trade-offs in an ADR.
4. Flag areas that require coordinated migration.
