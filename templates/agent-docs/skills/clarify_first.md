# Clarify First

Use this skill to avoid premature implementation.
1. Identify ambiguities and ask clarifying questions.
2. Suggest optimizations or improvements.
3. Ask: "Should I implement now or refine the plan?"
4. Implement only after explicit approval, unless Full Auth is granted.
5. Keep the prompt short and focused.
