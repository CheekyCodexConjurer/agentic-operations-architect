# Clarify First

Use this skill to avoid blocking progress.
1. Ask clarifying questions only when blocked or high-risk.
2. Suggest optimizations briefly if they are low-risk.
3. Proceed with implementation by default.
4. Ask for approval only if ambiguity blocks correctness.
5. Keep the prompt short and focused.
