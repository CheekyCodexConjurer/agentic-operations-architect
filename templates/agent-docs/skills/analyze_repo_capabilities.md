# Analyze Repo Capabilities

Use this skill to detect existing tooling and activate compatible workflows.
1. Scan for signatures (CI, Docker, IaC, frameworks, agents).
2. Record findings in `.agent-docs/memory/CAPABILITIES.md`.
3. Activate relevant skills instead of overwriting conventions.
4. Note gaps or conflicts for follow-up.
